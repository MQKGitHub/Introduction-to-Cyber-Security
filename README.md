# 🧠 Introduction to Cyber Security

Welcome to my learning journey through the **Introduction to Cyber Security** path on TryHackMe. This section lays the foundation for understanding how attackers think (offensive security), how defenders protect systems, and the various career paths in cyber security.

Each room is documented in its own folder within this repo, with detailed notes and reflections on what I learned and experienced.
